If the current branch has uncomitted changes, debase considers all instances of that branch read-only (eg master, master~10, and other skip'd instances)

Previously-fixed bug: With no undo history on any branch, copy commits from one branch to another
    Undo history should now be populated

Delete commits using delete key

History lost when head commit doesn't match saved commit

Moving mouse and exiting debase doesn't result in mouse-moved escape sequences being printed to terminal

Running debase with a newer version of com.heytoaster.debase/Version: exits without allowing debase to be used

Ctrl-C exits while dragging selection rect
Ctrl-C exits while dragging context menu

--machineid flag works

<rev>^^^ syntax works, and branch is editable

<rev>~3 syntax works, and branch is editable

* General tag editing: same as General branch editing

* Edit commit
Edit commit with double-click
Edit commit with return key
Edit commit but don't make changes -> commit id doesn't change
Edit commit and change date
Edit commit with vi
Edit commit with pico
Edit commit with TextMate

* Readonly rev
Copy commits allowed
Move commits disallowed
Delete commits disallowed
Edit commit disallowed

* Register window
Resize terminal
Text field interactions (arrow keys, delete, forward delete)
Registration works
Click text fields
Ctrl-C exits
Ctrl-D exits
Cmd-. exits
Esc doesn't close (unless dismiss is allowed)
Clicking outside is ignored
Return key triggers OK button

* Error panel
Resize terminal vertically + vertical clipping
Resize terminal horizontally + horizontal clipping
Dismiss with OK key
Dismiss with escape key

* Bad commit id in state file
Corrupt snapshot commit id in repo state file -- snapshot hidden
Corrupt undo commit id in repo state file -- shows error
Corrupt redo commit id in repo state file -- shows error

* Context menu
Right mouse down -> drag -> select -- works?
Right mouse down+up -> select -- works?
Menu is re-positioned to prevent clipping when right-clicking near terminal edge
When menu is re-positioned away from terminal edge, clicking buttons still works (ie hitzone is correctly calculated)
Resize terminal while menu is open -> menu disappears
Esc dismissed menu

* Snapshots menu
Set active snapshot
Undo set snapshot
Redo set snapshot
Left mouse down -> drag -> select
Left mouse down+up -> select
Menu properly clipped if window is too small to contain it
Resize terminal while menu is open -> menu dismissed
Clicking button after opening snapshots menu requires delay + moving mouse 1 character

* Theme
Dark mode looks good
Light mode looks good
Light mode automatically detected
Dark mode automatically detected
Setting theme=light works
Setting theme=dark works
Setting theme=auto works

* License
Entering valid license works
Trial: A file in the git repo from the future should cause debase to assume the future date of the file
Trial license is deleted upon expiration
Too many machine ids prevents registration
Starting a trial after it's expired doesn't work
Server doesn't send trial license if it's expired
A mismatched machine id triggers a license renewal, renewal succeeds silently if there is a machine slot available
A mismatched machine id triggers a license renewal, renewal fails and shows dialog fails if no machine slots available
A mismatched machine id + no internet shows renewal dialog immediately
A mismatched machine id + stalled internet (ie Network::Request() takes a long time) shows renewal dialog after 5s
Valid license still works after 2 weeks (ensures that trial logic isn't interfering)
Incorrect email prevents registration
Incorrect license code prevents registration
Corrupting the license on disk is detected because the signature is wrong
Make sure MachineInfo is properly sent to the server
A mismatched machine id during trial mode shows the welcome dialog
Buying a license with one email capitalization, and registering with a different capitalization works
Buying a license + registering with a new email address works (ie an email that isn't in the database)
Starting a trial with a new machine id works (ie a machine id that isn't in the database)
Verify that if the client's internet connection fails during checkout, the webhook still triggers an email to be sent
    This can be simulated by changing the /debase/license/buy-finish endpoint to have an incorrect address

* License escape
Welcome alert: can't be escaped
Renewal alert (ie mismatched machine id): can't be escaped
Trial expired alert: can't be escaped

* Server
Stress test server by hitting it with lots of requests simultaneously

* Privacy
No network IO occurs on first launch, until a button is clicked
Machine ID isn't calculated on first launch until a button is clicked

* Move Offer
debase offers to move itself with zsh
debase offers to move itself with bash

Moving debase works with zsh, when PATH does include the destination dir
Moving debase works with bash, when PATH does include the destination dir

Moving debase works with zsh, when PATH didn't originally include the destination dir
Moving debase works with bash, when PATH didn't originally include the destination dir

After first launch, debase can be launched a second time after running the suggested command (printed at exit of the first launch)

* Clickable Links
Clicking URL works
Clicking email address works

* Update check
Update dialog appears when there's an update available
Update dialog isn't shown after clicking ignore
Update dialog is shown for versions > the version that was ignored
Update check doesn't occur on first launch
